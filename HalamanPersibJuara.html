               Not so many people know about the benefits of phenol, especially for ordinary people. For that we will share a little knowledge with friends all about how to manufacture phenol and its benefits.
The benefits of Phenol are:
- Can repel pests and diseases such as grasshoppers, aphis, rats, and also can prevent the entry of bacteria into the body of plants that can cause fungi on leaves, stems, or fruit.
- In addition, Phenol can also eliminate fishy odors. Way, Phenol in water mixed then ikanya insert into it.
  How to make Phenol
- How to make phenol is actually very easy and cheap, but we often ignore.
For example, burning smoke, in fact the combustion smoke can repel pests and diseases.
To make phenol from burning asp, we can use charcoal husk then smoke in flute. Well the result of the distillation of smoke that is a liquid phenol.
  Phenol has a limited solubility in water, ie 8.3 grams / 100 ml. Phenol has an acidic nature, meaning it can release H + ions from its hydroxyl group. The excretion of the ions makes the C6H5O-water-soluble phenoxide anion. Compared with other aliphatic alcohols, phenols are more acidic. This is evidenced by reacting phenol with NaOH, in which phenol can release H +. Under the same circumstances, other aliphatic alcohols can not react as such. This discharge is due to the orbital attachment between the sole oxygen pair and the aromatic system, which delocalizes the negative load through the ring and stabilizes the anion.
Phenols can be obtained by partial oxidation of benzene or benzoic acid by the Raschig process, Phenol can also be obtained as a result of coal oxidation.
C6H6 + 1 / 2O2-C6H5OH.
Use of Phenol: Phenol can be used as an antiseptic as Sir Joseph Lister used when practicing antiseptic surgery. Phenol is a major component of anstiseptic trade, trichlorophenol or otherwise known as TCP (trichlorophenol). Phenol is also part of the composition of some oral anestitics, for example chloraseptic spray.
Phenol functions in the manufacture of drugs (part of the production of aspirin, weeds, and others.
Concentrated phenols can result in chemical burning of the exposed skin.
Phenol injections have also been used in death execution. This injection is often used during the Nazi Germany, World War II. Phenol injections were given to thousands of people in the tents, especially in Auschwitz-Birkenau. This injection is done by the doctor injecting into the vein (intravenous) in the arm and heart. Injections into the heart can result in immediate death.
